# Chest X-Ray Diagnostics with YOLOv5 and VinBigData Dataset
This repository implements a YOLOv5 based system for detecting and classifying abnormalities in chest X-ray images using the VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection Dataset.

**Project Goals**
- Utilize YOLOv5 for object detection and classification of chest X-ray abnormalities.
- Achieve accurate localization and classification of various pathologies within the lungs.
- Provide a framework for further development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for chest X-rays.

**Dependencies**
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection Dataset (download from https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection)
